# TIC-TAC-TOE-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with X or O. The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This repository contains a simple implementation of the game in Python TKinter library and AI Minimax Algorithm.
